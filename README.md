# KennelMap

Kennel Map is a full stack web application developed for Companion Animal Hospital to track and manage dog locations within the kennel. Built with Vue.js and Supabase/PostgreSQL, it allows users to easily assign dogs to kennel runs and rearrange them using a drag-and-drop interface. Users can also save kennel layouts to help plan for busy periods.
